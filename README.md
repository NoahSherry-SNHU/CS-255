# CS-255
SNHU CS255 work

The DriverPass project was a fictional system that we as CS255 students had to create a mock system analysis and implementaion documents for. This system was created to help student drivers schedule driving testing sessions and manage all the subsequent data and users associated with this.

One thing I think I did particularly well in this course was to create well-details design requirements for this mock system.

If I could revise one part of these documents, I'd fix my initial UML use case diagrams to include all of the required use cases outlined by the client.

I interpreted the user's needs to implement them into my system design by carefully reading the client meeting transcript many times to make sure I was understanding what the clients were expecting from the system. This step is extremely important because it doesn't matter how good a system is designed or built if it inevitable missed the client's requirements.
    
I approach designing softwar by first carefully documenting the requirements needed for the progam and then creating a list of all the necessary components I'll need to interface with. In the future, I could do a better job of using project planning software like LucidChart to better illustrate my UML designs, as I usually create these with MS Paint.
